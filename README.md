Facial expression recognition from static images is a challenging computer vision problem.Facial expression has a lot of real world application in real world like studying the human behaviour being one of themIn this project, we have used 
transfer learning technique in order to create a model capable of recognizing the human facial expression. Finally we use the trained model, and create a quantized model from this and compare the results.
In this problem, I have used the CK+ dataset. In 2000,the Cohn-Kanade (CK) database was released for the purpose of promoting research into automatically detecting individual facial expressions. This is one of the best and oldest dataset
used for the face expression recognition problem. It has a total of 981 images and which has images for 7 different expression.
I have uploaded all the notebooks. For each model there are 3 notebook for each model used, one for float32,float16 and int 8.
The model file size was quite high so they can't be uploaded, if someone wants them I can share that to them.
I have also uploaded separate file facial landmarks.
